The story of Earnest and the Haunted Stamford Inn

Stamford, Texas is a small city located in the north-central region of the state.

Constructed in 1890, the Stamford Inn was an exclusive and some would even call it a "swanky" place. 

At the time, the hotel was called the Plains Hotel and was located near the railroad tracks that ran through Stamford. It was a popular spot for travelers who were passing through town, as well as for locals who wanted to enjoy a night out.

 The hotel is said to be haunted by several spirits, including that of a woman who is said to have died in one of the rooms, a man who committed suicide in the hotel, and a young girl who drowned in the hotel's swimming pool.

 On Christmas Eve 1924,  it was destroyed by a fire. 

Five people died in the fire including a man named Ernest, who was trying to save others including a mother & two children.

Ernest & the others were in the elevator when the floor collapsed and they fell to a fiery death below

Ernest's body was found on top of the furnace in the lower basement.

The building was re-built on top of the original site, using the exact same blue prints and in fact the basement is actually the same basement from the original structure.

The final resting place of Ernest.


The Stamford Inn after being rebuilt, was later shut down in the 70s and was repurposed into a nursing home  which it was used for many years.

This is the staff basement where patients were serviced from.


After complaints about patient abuse, the nursing home was shut down and eventually the building became a private club.

This is the upper lounge and common areas.




Eventually the club was abandoned in the early 80s. 
due to numerous reports of the building being haunted.

It has sat vacant since then.
