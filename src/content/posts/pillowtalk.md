<!-- ### America's Favorite Pillow Guy has a brand new show out, called PillowTalk! Let's hope Mike find True Loveâ„¢ and a great night's sleep. 

<br /> -->
Mike Lindell is the founder and CEO of MyPillow, a pillow manufacturing company based in Chaska, Minnesota. He is known for his colorful personality and aggressive marketing tactics, which have made MyPillow one of the most recognizable brands in the bedding industry.
<br /><br />
MyPillow was founded in 2004 and has since grown into a multi-million dollar company. The company is known for its patented interlocking fill, which is designed to adjust to the user's individual needs and provide a comfortable sleeping experience. MyPillow also offers a variety of pillows in different shapes, sizes, and firmness levels to meet the needs of a wide range of customers.
<br /><br />
In addition to his business success, Lindell has been a controversial figure in recent years due to his political activism and support of former President Donald Trump. He has made a number of false claims about the 2020 US presidential election, including that it was rigged and that the election software used by Dominion Voting Systems was responsible for widespread fraud. These claims have been widely discredited and Lindell has faced a number of legal challenges as a result.
<br /><br />
Despite the controversy, Lindell remains a popular figure among a certain segment of the population and continues to be a vocal supporter of conservative causes and candidates. He has used his platform to promote his political beliefs and has been a frequent guest on conservative news programs.
<br /><br />
In conclusion, Mike Lindell and MyPillow have become household names in the bedding industry, but Lindell's political activism and controversial statements have also made him a polarizing figure. Regardless of one's political views, however, it is clear that Lindell's determination and marketing savvy have been key factors in the success of MyPillow.

<br /><br />
