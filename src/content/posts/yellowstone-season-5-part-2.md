## Another crazy season in Montana!

As this trailer shows the drama and amazing action that has kept us glued to our couches is going to crescendo with the Part Two of Season 5 (Crescendo means to "increase in intensity", for some fans of this show that might not be familiar with that term).

Look for even more action than ever before, and the high stakes drama of possibly losing the ranch will become almost too hard to bear for some. Hinting at an exit of a main character from the show this season. 

We'll get you more information as that one pans out, but for now, enjoy the rest of winter and please share this while you're waiting for Summer of 2023 to arrive.


## More about YellowStone

"Yellowstone" is a television drama series that revolves around the Dutton family, who controls the largest contiguous ranch in the United States, which also borders the fictional Yellowstone National Park. The series follows John Dutton, the patriarch of the family, as he tries to protect his land and his family from various threats, including developers, politicians, and native American tribes.

Throughout the series, the Duttons are constantly engaged in political and legal battles to maintain control of their land and to protect their way of life. The family is also plagued by internal conflicts, including rivalries between siblings and struggles for power within the family.

John Dutton's children include Kayce, a former Navy SEAL who has returned to the ranch to work as a cattleman; Jamie, a lawyer who works for the family; Beth, the CEO of the family's business interests; and Tate, John's youngest son who is torn between his loyalty to the family and his desire to live a different life.

The show explores themes of family, power, greed, and the struggle to maintain control in a rapidly changing world. The spectacular scenery of Montana and the drama of life on a large ranch make "Yellowstone" a unique and compelling viewing experience.
