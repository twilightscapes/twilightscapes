## Ex-President Donald Trump's stance on law enforcement during his presidency was complex and at times controversial.


On one hand, he expressed strong support for law enforcement and pledged to give them more resources and support. He signed executive orders aimed at increasing the power of police, such as making it easier to use military equipment and improving access to surplus military equipment for local police departments (Great, more militarization of our police forces!).

On the other hand, his response to protests against police brutality and racial injustice was criticized by many for being divisive and further escalating tensions between law enforcement and communities of color. During these protests, Trump was seen as being supportive of heavy-handed tactics used by some police officers, and he even suggested that the military could be used to quell the unrest.

Additionally, some of the policies and actions of the Trump administration, such as the zero-tolerance immigration policy, led to increased tensions between law enforcement and immigrant communities, which can harm the relationship between police and the communities they serve.

In summary, the impact of President Trump's actions on law enforcement can be seen as damaging, and the overall effect has been to further division in the Country making it US vs THEM.
