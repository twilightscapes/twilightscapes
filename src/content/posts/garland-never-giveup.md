Merrick Garland, as the current Attorney General of the United States, he has faced numerous challenges throughout his career, but he has <strong>never given up</strong> on his mission to uphold the rule of law and defend the Constitution.

In many ways, Garland's approach to his work can be summed up in the lyrics of the classic Rick Astley hit, "<strong>Never Gonna Give You Up.</strong>" Just as Astley sings, "<strong>Never gonna give you up</strong>, never gonna let you down," Garland has never wavered in his commitment to justice, even in the face of adversity.

Garland's journey to his current position has not been an easy one. In 2016, he was nominated by then-President Barack Obama to serve as a Supreme Court Justice. However, his nomination was blocked by Senate Republicans, who refused to hold a confirmation vote. Despite this setback, Garland <strong>did not give up</strong>. He continued to serve as the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and in 2021, he was nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as the Attorney General.

Throughout his career, Garland has been known for his dedication to public service and his unwavering commitment to upholding the law. He has prosecuted numerous high-profile cases, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and he has been a leading advocate for civil rights and criminal justice reform.

In many ways, Garland embodies the values of the American justice system. He is a man of integrity, fairness, and compassion, and he has dedicated his life to ensuring that the law is applied equally to all.

As the Attorney General, Garland faces numerous challenges, from prosecuting domestic terrorists to combating systemic racism in law enforcement. However, just as Astley sings, "<strong>Never gonna run around and desert you</strong>," Garland is determined to stay the course and fight for justice, no matter what obstacles he may face.

In conclusion, Merrick Garland is a true embodiment of the spirit of "<strong>Never Gonna Give You Up.</strong>" He has never given up on his mission to uphold the rule of law and defend the Constitution, and he has never let adversity stand in his way. As Attorney General, he will continue to fight for justice, just as Astley sings, "<strong>Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye.</strong>"
