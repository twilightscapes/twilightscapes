## America's Favorite Pillow Guy has a brand NEW product out, called "My Last Bed"! 

<br />
<div style="text-align:left;">
My Pillow is a company that was founded in 2004 by Mike Lindell, a former crack cocaine addict who turned his life around and started his own business. The company is best known for its eponymous product, the My Pillow, which is a pillow that is filled with interlocking pieces of foam to provide customizable support and comfort.

Since its founding, My Pillow has become one of the most recognizable brands in the bedding industry, thanks in large part to its aggressive marketing campaign. The company's commercials feature Lindell himself, who promises that the My Pillow is the solution to all your sleep problems and that it will last a lifetime.

One of the key features of My Pillow's marketing strategy is its emphasis on customer testimonials. The company's commercials are filled with real-life customers who swear by the My Pillow and claim that it has changed their lives. This approach has helped My Pillow build a loyal customer base and has made it one of the most popular pillows on the market.

In addition to its TV commercials, My Pillow has also taken advantage of other marketing channels, such as infomercials, direct mail, and online advertising. The company has been especially successful in using infomercials, which allow it to provide detailed information about its product and to demonstrate how it works.

Despite its success, however, My Pillow's marketing has not been without controversy. Some people have criticized the company for making misleading claims about the health benefits of its product, and others have taken issue with Lindell's aggressive sales tactics.

Despite these criticisms, My Pillow remains one of the most successful bedding companies in the world, and its marketing campaign continues to be a driving force behind its growth. Whether you love or hate My Pillow, there's no denying that the company's marketing strategy has helped it become one of the most recognizable and successful brands in the bedding industry.
