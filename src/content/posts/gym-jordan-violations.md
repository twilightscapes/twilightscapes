## Gym Jordan is a man who has consistently put his own interests above those of his constituents. 

</span>

<br />




He has shown time and time again that he is not fit for public office, and his actions have proven that he is more interested in furthering his own political ambitions than serving the people he was elected to represent.

Jordan's reputation was already tarnished due to his involvement in the Ohio State wrestling scandal, where he was accused of ignoring allegations of sexual abuse against the team doctor. But he has continued to engage in unethical and potentially illegal behavior since then, proving that he is not fit to hold any public office.

Jordan's role in the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol cannot be overlooked. Despite the overwhelming evidence of voter fraud, Jordan continued to push the false narrative that the election was stolen from Donald Trump. He even went as far as to object to the certification of the electoral college results, despite the fact that there was no evidence to support his claims of fraud.

But it doesn't stop there. Jordan has consistently engaged in partisan attacks against Democrats, even when it is not in the best interests of his constituents. He has refused to support measures that would improve access to healthcare, education, and social services for the people of Ohio, all while pushing tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.

Jordan's actions are a direct affront to the principles of democracy. He has shown time and time again that he is more interested in protecting his own political career than working for the betterment of the people he represents. He has repeatedly shown that he is willing to lie, cheat, and engage in unethical behavior to get what he wants.

It's time for the people of Ohio to wake up and realize that Gym Jordan is not working for them. He is a man who is only interested in furthering his own career, even if it means sacrificing the values that he claims to hold dear. The people of Ohio deserve better than Gym Jordan, and it's time for them to make their voices heard.
